Perl VIII - Modules - Problem Set

1. Download and install a module using CPAN

	On the iMac in front of you, open a Terminal window and type the following:

	$ sudo cpan
	password is your password

	CPAN should ask if you want to configure automatically. Say YES.
	Once it's done configuring, you should get a cpan prompt like this:

	cpan>

	Type the following to install the module Math::Round:

	cpan> install Math::Round

	then, once it's installed, write a short script that uses the round() to round any numbers
	entered as arguments on the command line.


2. Take the subroutine that you created in the subroutines problem set, and make it into a module.

3. Modify your script from the subroutines problem set so that it now calls that subroutine from the module.

4. Modify the module to automatically export the subroutine by default.

5. (optional bonus question) Write a script to read FASTA files. Make a module with four subroutines.

	Each subroutine will take a FASTA sequence as input. Then, write one subroutine for each of the following:

	- getting the name (sequence ID) of the sequence
	- getting the description of the sequence
	- getting the sequence itself
	- reformatting the sequence to be a user-specified number of characters
	  per line
