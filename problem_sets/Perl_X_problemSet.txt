Perl X Problem Set
====================
1. Take a look at the Statistics::Descriptive module on cpan.
2. Write a script that uses the methods in Statistics::Descriptive to calculate the standard deviation, median, min, and max of the following numbers:
 
                 12,-13,-12,7,11,-4,-12,9,6,7,-9
 
Optional questions:
 
3.Add a method to Microarray.pm called expression() which returns the expression value.
 
4. Currently, calling $a = $m->gene() gets the value of gene in the object $m. Modify the gene() method such that if you call gene() with an argument, it will set the value of gene to be that argument.
eg:
$m->gene('FOXP1');  # this should set gene name to 'FOXP1'
print $m->gene();   # this should print the value 'FOXP1'
