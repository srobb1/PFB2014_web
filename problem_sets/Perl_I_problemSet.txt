==================
Perl 1 Problem Set
==================
 
1. Start your first script. Make sure to include (exactly this, if it has extra white space or comments it will not work):
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings; 
 
2. Write a script to print out "Hello New York";
 
3. Store your name in a variable and print the contents of this variable.
 
4. Create a print statement with tabs (\t) and newlines (\n)
 
5. Create a print statement and use double quotes. 

6. Create the same statement and use single quotes. Compare the output.
	-- add \t and \n to each of these print statements
  	-- add variables to each of these print statements
	-- add a math statement (ex: 2+3)
	-- how can you get your print statement to print 5 and not '2+3'.
 
7. What is the difference between single and double quotes.
